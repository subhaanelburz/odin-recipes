# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project foundations course.

The recipe website consisted of:
    - A homepage with 3 links to the following recipes:
        - Hot Honey Drumsticks
        - Grilled Cheese
        - Mongolian Beef

Additionally, each recipe page had:
    - A title
    - A description
    - An image
    - Ingredient list
    - Directions/Steps
    - Homepage link
    - Link to recipe source

This website was coded entirely in HTML, and I used the following elements:
    - Ordered Lists
    - Unordered Lists
    - Paragraphs
    - Headings
    - Images
    - Relative Links
    - Absolute Links
